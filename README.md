## what is react js?

Released by Facebook in 2013, React is a JavaScript library for building modern applications. React is used for handling the view layer and can be used for development of both web and mobile applications.


### What is npm?

npm is the world's largest Software Registry. The registry contains over 800,000 code packages. Open-source developers use npm to share software.

### what is state in react js?

State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation. It's managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function)

### what is Effect in react js?


When you call useEffect , you're telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render — including the first render.
